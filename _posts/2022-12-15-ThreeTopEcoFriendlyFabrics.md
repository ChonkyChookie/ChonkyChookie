## Introduction

Fabric is one of the most important elements in any home. It's how we decorate our rooms and furnishings, as well as what we use for our clothes and bedding. But did you know that there are other ways to make your fabrics eco friendly? If you're looking for something new or just want an upgrade on your current choices, these three fabrics might be right up your alley: organic cotton, hemp, and linen!

## Organic Cotton

Organic cotton is grown without the use of pesticides or fertilizers. It's a renewable resource, which means it can be used again in the future. In addition, organic cotton is grown using sustainable practices and methods that don't harm the environment or human health (notably it doesn't contain genetically modified organisms).

If you're looking for eco-friendly fabrics that are also comfortable and soft, organic cotton is what you want!

## Hemp

Hemp is a sustainable, renewable resource that can be used in countless ways. With its natural properties and low environmental impact, hemp has become a popular choice for those who want to be eco friendly.

Hemp is an excellent option for those who want to be more eco friendly because it requires no pesticides or fertilizers to grow which means your clothes will not have any harmful chemicals on them. The fibers found in the hemp plant are strong and durable so they can be used in clothing as well as other products like paper or rope. The plant grows quickly after being planted and produces large amounts of fiber per acre compared with cotton which takes about five times longer!

## Linen

Linen is a natural fabric made from flax. It’s also known as linen, cotton and hemp. Linen can be used to make clothing, bedding and many other items such as tablecloths and napkins.

Linen is a sustainable fabric because it can be grown without pesticides or fertilizers. This means that you don't have to worry about toxic chemicals being used in the production process of your clothes or sheets!

## Conclusion

We hope that we’ve given you a better idea of what to look for in an eco friendly fabric, and how to find it. If you're still not sure, ask yourself if your goal is to be as green as possible in your daily life or just occasionally. The answer will help you determine where to start with your search.
