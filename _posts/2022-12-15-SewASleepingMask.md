## Introduction

If you're like me, this project will make you want to try your hand at sewing. It was easy for me to learn how to sew and I'm sure that anyone would be able to do it with a little patience and practice. The end result is a sleeping mask that looks great and can be worn with any outfit!

## This easy project makes a great gift.

This project makes a great gift. The sleeping mask is perfect for anyone who travels and likes to sleep in, or anyone who likes to sleep in a dark room.

You can use any fabric you want, but I recommend using fleece because it's easy to iron, washable, and soft.

## What You'll Need

Fabric

Elastic

Thread (for the elastic)

## Cut the pattern out of the fabric.

To make sure your mask is the right size, you'll need to measure the circumference of your head. You can do this by wrapping a measuring tape around your head and marking where it meets at its widest point (usually just above the eyebrows). Then mark another line on that same spot and draw an upside-down "V" shape in between them. The distance between those two lines will give you an idea of how much fabric is needed for each side of your sleeping mask.

Once you have cut out all four pieces of fabric—two front panels and two back panels—sew them together along one side seam (the part where they meet each other) with regular sewing machine stitches: pinning as necessary so that everything stays straight while sewing through multiple layers at once; use backstitching or hand stitching only if absolutely necessary (this isn't necessary unless there are major sections sewn together).

## Add the elastic and sew it together.

Sew the elastic on the back side of the mask.

Sew it to the mask, but leave a little space to be able to adjust it later.

## Mark your place to sew the elastic.

Measure the length of elastic you will need and mark it with a pin. You can use your ruler or measuring tape, whichever is more comfortable for you! When marking, make sure that all measurements are straight and even across each piece of fabric before moving onto the next step in this process.

## Sew the seam around the edge of the fabric.

Use a straight stitch, starting at one side of your fabric and moving in a continuous line along its entire length. As you sew, use light pressure to keep everything neat and even; don't worry about being precise here—the mask is going to look great even if it's not perfect!

## Flatten and sew it so that it looks nice and is comfortable to wear.

It is also important to flatten and sew the sleeping mask so that it looks nice and is comfortable to wear. A flat sleeping mask will help keep your eyes from getting too dry while you sleep, which can happen when you use a foldable one. If you have trouble sewing with a machine, try using an ironing board instead; this way, you won't have an uneven surface under which to work!

## A sleeping mask can be yours with a little patience, creativity and bit of material.

A sleeping mask is a great gift, and it's easy to make. You can use any type of fabric, elastic and color. The only limit is your imagination!

The sewing pattern will show you how to cut out the pieces for each side of the sleeping mask. Once you've made this part of your project, follow these steps:

Sew together two pieces of fabric with right sides facing each other so that they overlap slightly at one end (this will be where we attach our elastic).

Cut two strips of 1/2 inch wide elastic that are long enough to wrap around both sides of your face comfortably while still being short enough so they don’t slip off easily when sleeping at night (you may want to double check this measurement before cutting).

## Conclusion

And there you have it! A sleeping mask that will keep your eyes from drying out and will keep your face warm. It’s easy to make, easy to wear and won’t take too much time or energy. You can now start sewing on those masks for all of your friends who love sleeping in those cold winter months.
