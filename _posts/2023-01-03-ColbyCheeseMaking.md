Last Christmas my mom gifted me a cheesemaking gift from the New England Cheese Making Co. I had expressed some interest in cheesemaking, as it seems related to several of my other interests of cooking and baking. However I also got the feeling my mom very much wanted to try homemade cheese without actually having to make the homemade cheese. 

About a year ago, I did in fact make a feta cheese block. That experience was filled with much stress over the tedious nature of cheese. Plus the resulting feta was mediocre at best and not at all worth the time and effort (mainly because I didn't at all enjoy the cheesemaking process). I tucked away the cheesemaking kit and forgot all about it for a year. 

But then a few weeks ago, it resurfaced in conversation. Enough time had passed since the feta that I had forgotten how much I despised the process. Perhaps naively, perhaps foolishly, I decided to reattempt cheesemaking. Once we had gotten the two gallons of milk, I was too committed to turn around. 

Originally I wanted to make cheddar but reading through the instructions, it seemed far too tedious for me to have any hope. There was some step about heating the pot in the sink slowly. I have no clue how I was expected to manage that. Funny enough, checking the website seems to have better and more detailed steps. Should have checked it before diving into the deep end, ahhh... live and learn.

## Cheese making process
In my two cheese blocks of cheese making experience, there seems to be a few stages.
- Heating milk with cultures
- Adding rennet
- Cutting curds
- Cooking curds
- Draining curds
- Pressing cheese
- Waxing cheese

For reference, I followed the Colby cheese making recipe from the New England Cheese Making Co. The printed recipe booklet appears to be quite a bit simplified from the online version 
[Colby Recipe - Cheese Making Supply](https://cheesemaking.com/products/colby-recipe). 


### Heating milk with cultures
The process begins with finding a pot big enough for two gallons of milk and then heating that to 86F. Toss in the cultures and stir. Then try to maintain the heat while allowing the milk to rest for a hour. During this hour try not to question why you decided to reattempt cheesemaking.

### Adding Rennet
Toss in a dissolved thing of rennet. Don't stir while the magic happens

### Cutting Curds
Come back some time later, the milk is now a solid. Time to start cutting the curds. The first few cuts are satisfying but then you have to deal with OCD as the lines are no longer straight, the curds are bouncing about, the mass of milk does not want to cooperate.

### Cook the curds
Finally get to stir up the curds and realize how uneven you cut the curds.

### Draining curds
Remove the whey and see just how little cheese 2 gallons make. Also a Colby particular thing seems to be washing the curds with water in order to cool down the temperature. Not that I know much about cheese making.

After some time drain the curds completely, salt, and admire the cheese curds that have made it this far. 

### Press the cheese
If you are like me, make some makeshift version of a cheese press with weights around the house. Naturally this resulted in a uneven, unsightly cheese block. Accept the fact the cheese will never be Instagram worthy, just like yourself XD

### Wax the cheese
Finally wax the cheese to get it ready for long time storage. After this process and all it's ups and downs, I was relived to put it out of my sight.

For the wax I heated up the cheese wax in a double broiler using a leftover glass jar. I had read online that anything that touches the wax should just be considered a donation to the cheese wax gods. Following that opinion, I chose a natural bristled brush as sacrifice in order to paint the wax on the cheese

I haven't at all mastered the art of painting the wax on the cheese. What appeared as quite fun and satisfying turned out to be slightly frustrating as the wax almost immediately hardens upon touching the cheese. Any drips quickly become a long term feature of the wax. Also don't wear clothing you don't want wax on. It doesn't come off easily though I am hopeful that pouring boiling water on clothes should remove the wax.

## Final thoughts
Perhaps the most irritating part of this entire process is the waiting. Instead of getting a chance to taste the product, I must wait while the cheese ages. In the meantime, all I can do is hope the process worked. 

In 2 months I might have more thoughts but for now, all I have is a waxed cheese block sitting in a pantry.
