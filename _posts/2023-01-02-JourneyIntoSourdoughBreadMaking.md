I'm a bit late to the game. Back at the start of March 2020 with the lockdowns of Covid, everyone seemed to be getting into sourdough bread making. Despite my propensity  towards baking, I never got caught up in the trend. It was only during this past month that I was inspired to try out sourdough bread making.

## Research
Like everything I do, I had to go research. I wanted to find real legit sourdough bread makers, not just the blog post with the best SEO and long winded story about their dog or grandmother. I chanced upon the channel of [Culinary Exploration - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCezJ2OMlEwVJ5tMitCYL6DQ) and his bread and method just felt legit and of a well seasoned sourdough breadmaker.

I chose to try the [The Old Faithful - a Country Style Sourdough Recipe](https://www.culinaryexploration.eu/blog/old-faithful). I appreciated the fact it had a tad bit of whole wheat but otherwise pretty plain sourdough. I gave the instructions a solid read through, watched the video and then made my first loaf.

## My First Loaf
I had to make a few modifications to the recipe. I only had all purpose flour on hand so used gluten vitals to increase the protein of the flour. For the levain, I put closer to 10g of sourdough starter. 

Also, instead of rice flour, I used coconut flour to prevent the shaped dough from sticking to the basket. And in my case, I didn't have a proper banneton proofing basket so I substituted a plastic oval container covered with a  linen handkerchief. I had zero issues with sticking and seemed to work alright.

I tried to follow the timing pretty closely. However this may have been unwise given my house temperature was running close to 64F whereas the recipe mentions the room temperature running 82F. I tried to compensate by heating the oven slightly, close to 72F for the stages of bulk fermentation and stretching and proofing. 

Nevertheless, after about 48 hours, I created this beauty.

I did take note the bubbles seem like they could be more even and bigger but overall was happy with this first attempt. And the flavor was certainly there and it was inhaled by my family within hours. 

## Second and Thirds loafs
For the second and thirds loafs, I mainly continued doing what I was doing with some small adjustments. I increased the bulk fermentation time, trying to focus more on hitting the 75% size increase rather than focusing on the time given in the recipe. To aid in this, I place the dough in a glass measuring bowl. I ended up reaching around 8-9 hours in this phrase and even then felt like it could have gone another hour. 

Ironically though, improved bulk fermentation meant increased amounts of bubbles. And those bubbles than made shaping the dough far more difficult. Now not only are you gently trying tension the bread without breaking it, but also trying to avoid deflating it.

As you can see the bubble distribution is vastly improved here. Still is a far cry from the recipe pic but it was only my second loaf. My third loaf was slightly better but it seems I forgot to get a picture of it's cross section :(

## Reflection
After three loafs, I too have fallen deeply into the world of sourdough breadmaking and can't stop thinking of how the process could be improved. Owh, and the bread tastes amazing and puts white loaf bread to shame. 

In terms of improving, I could either increase the bulk fermentation time or increase the temperature during this time. In addition, work on being more light-fingered during the shaping period. 

If I continue with sourdough making, it might be worthwhile to invest in a banneton. I'm not sure how much of a difference it would make but every decent sourdough bread maker appears to use one. 

Also, if I make sourdough again, I might experiment with variations and different recipes. I certainly love the Old Faithful recipe, but I would be curious to see what differences the ingredients make.
